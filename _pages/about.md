I am an electrical and electronic engineer. I am currently working at [the Advanced Wireless and Communication Research Center](https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/research/researchcenters/awcc.html), [the University of Electro-Communications](https://www.uec.ac.jp/) (UEC), specializing in joint wireless information and power transfer for implantable medical devices. I hold an overseas JSPS postdoctoral fellowship. 
  
I received my Ph.D. from  [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. My research was focused on body area networks.
  
From 2023 to 2025, I was a JSPS postdoctoral researcher at [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/ee/eng/), [the Institute of Science Tokyo](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) (TokyoTech), Tokyo, Japan.

From 2021 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [the Intervention Center](https://www.ivs.no), [Oslo University Hospital](https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/oslo-university-hospital) (OUS), Oslo, Norway. I also worked as a guest researcher at [the Department of Electronic Systems](https://www.ntnu.edu/ies), [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.
  
My interests span diverse topics, including wireless technology, information theory and finite element methods for **implantable medical devices**. If you are interested in our work, **[email](mailto:maoyuan.li.bit@gmail.com) contact is preferable**.
