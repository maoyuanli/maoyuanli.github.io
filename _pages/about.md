I am an electrical and electronic engineer. I am currently working at <a href="https://www.uec.ac.jp/eng/research/researchcenters/awcc.html">the Advanced Wireless and Communication Research Center</a>, <a href="https://www.uec.ac.jp/">the University of Electro-Communications</a> (UEC), specializing in joint wireless information and power transfer for implantable medical devices. I hold an overseas JSPS postdoctoral fellowship.

I received my Ph.D. from <a href="https://english.bit.edu.cn/">Beijing Institute of Technology</a>, Beijing, China. My research was focused on body area networks.

From 2023 to 2025, I was a JSPS postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://educ.titech.ac.jp/ee/eng/">the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.titech.ac.jp/english">the Institute of Science Tokyo</a> (TokyoTech), Tokyo, Japan.

From 2021 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://www.ivs.no">the Intervention Center</a>, <a href="https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/oslo-university-hospital">Oslo University Hospital</a> (OUS), Oslo, Norway. I also worked as a guest researcher at <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/ies">the Department of Electronic Systems</a>, <a href="https://www.ntnu.edu/">Norwegian University of Science and Technology</a> (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.

My interests span diverse topics, including wireless technology, information theory and finite element methods for <b>implantable medical devices</b>. If you are interested in our work, <a href="mailto:maoyuan.li.bit@gmail.com"><b>email contact is preferable</b></a>.
