I became an electrical and electronic engineer. I received my Ph.D. degree at [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), China, in 2021. From 2021 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher with [the Intervention Center](https://www.ivs.no), [Oslo University Hospital](https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/oslo-university-hospital) (OUS), Oslo, Norway. I also worked as a guest researcher at [the Department of Electronic Systems](https://www.ntnu.edu/ies), [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway. Presently, I hold the position of an overseas JSPS postdoctoral fellow at [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/ee/eng/), [the Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) (TokyoTech). My research interests span diverse topics, including implantable medical devices, joint wireless information and power transfer, information theory, finite element method and signal processing.
