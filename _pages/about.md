I am an electrical and electronic engineer. I am currently working at [the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/ee/eng/), [the Tokyo Institute of Technology](https://www.titech.ac.jp/english) (TokyoTech), specializing in joint wireless information and power transfer for implantable medical devices. I am holding an overseas JSPS postdoctoral fellow. 
  
I received my Ph.D. from  [Beijing Institute of Technology](https://english.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing, China. My research was focused on body area networks.
  
From 2021 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral researcher with [the Intervention Center](https://www.ivs.no), [Oslo University Hospital](https://www.oslo-universitetssykehus.no/oslo-university-hospital) (OUS), Oslo, Norway. I also worked as a guest researcher at [the Department of Electronic Systems](https://www.ntnu.edu/ies), [Norwegian University of Science and Technology](https://www.ntnu.edu/) (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway.
  
My interests span diverse topics, including wireless technology, information theory and finite element method.
